`update_env()`

Updates environment variables PATH and HOMEBREW_CACHE, and modifies DL_LOAD_PATH
to point to our Homebrew installation, allowing us to use things inside of
Homebrew transparently. This causes BinDeps to find the binaries during
Pkg.build() time, writing the absolute path into `deps/deps.jl`.  Because the
paths are written into `deps/deps.jl`, packages do not need to load in the entire
Homebrew package just to find their dependencies.

HOMEBREW_CACHE stores our bottle download cache in a separate place, separating
ourselves from other Homebrew installations so we don't conflict with anyone
